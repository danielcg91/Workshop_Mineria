# **Downloading Genomic Data**

## **Getting Genomic Data from the NCBI**

In the [previous episode](https://paumayell.github.io/pangenomics/01-introduction/index.html), we downloaded the working directory for this workshop that already contains the genomes of GBS strains `18RS21` and `H36B` within our `pan_workshop/data` directory. However, we need another six GBS strains that will be downloaded in this episode. For this purpose, we will learn how to use the specialized `ncbi-genome-download` [package](https://github.com/kblin/ncbi-genome-download), which was designed to automatically download one or several genomes directly from the NCBI by following specific filters set by user.

The `ncbi-genome-download` package can be installed with Conda. In our case, we have already installed it into the environment under the same name. To use the package, we just have to activate the *ncbi-genome-download* conda environment.

To start using the `ncbi-genome-download package`, we have to activate the conda environment where it was installed

``` bash
$ conda activate /miniconda3/envs/ncbi-genome-download
```

## Output

```
